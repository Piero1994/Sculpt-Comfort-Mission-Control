# What is it?
It's an app that lets you switch between virtual desktops on your Mac. With a mouse!

# Does it only work with Microsoft Sculpt Comfort mice?
Despite the name, no! It works with ANY mouse.

# Which macOS versions are supported?
The app was tested on 10.9 to 10.12. Starting from 10.11+ disabling SIP is required.

# I wonder if it works with my mouse
If you have a regular mouse, everything should work straight off. If not, or you're into customizing, see [Configuration folder](/Configuration).

# Still nothing... or I have a question
